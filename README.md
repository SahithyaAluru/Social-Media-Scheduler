# Social-Media-Scheduler
Goal: Design a tool that schedules and posts content across different social media platforms using API integration.
Structure:
        -User Interface: Design a console-based user interface for input and output, allowing users to interact with the calculator using simple commands or GUI using libraries like Tkinter (optional).
        -Functionality: Implement features to perform basic arithmetic operations, error handling for invalid inputs, and support for decimal or integer inputs.
        -Reports: Generate reports or logs of performed operations (optional) and save them into a text file or a database.

Technologies:
        -Python: For developing the application’s core logic and features.
        -Tkinter (Optional): For building a GUI-based calculator with buttons, input fields, and result displays.
        -SQLite (Optional): For saving the history of operations performed by the user.
        
Deliverables:
       -Complete Python project files (including source code and necessary configuration files).
       -A Python executable or script for running the application.
       -Documentation of the application’s functionality, usage, and setup.

Checklist:
      -Design the system for arithmetic operations with error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., dividing by zero).
      -Implement functionality for performing basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
      -Optionally implement GUI using Tkinter for a better user experience.
      -Optionally implement a history feature using SQLite or another method to store past operations.
      -Test the application for various edge cases (e.g., non-numeric input, division by zero).
      -Submit the completed project files and documentation.
